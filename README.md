# ArmCaptiveDecoder
Program for generating an instruction decoder for Captive derived from the ARM ISA specification

# ARM Specification
This program will be fed by the machine readable ARM spec, which can be downloaded from [this link](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/developer/products/architecture/armv8-a-architecture/ARMv82A-SysReg-00bet3.1.tar.gz). This should then be stored, within this project, in the directory "spec".
